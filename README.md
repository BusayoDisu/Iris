### PROJECT TITLE: "Iris Bloom: A Streamlit-powered Flower Prediction App"

Welcome to the repository for our Capstone project at Norquest College. This project aims to provide a seamless and interactive platform for users to input Iris flower features and receive accurate predictions, contributing to the ease of flower classification in both educational and research settings.

### Problem Statement

In the realm of botanical studies, there is a growing need for accessible and user-friendly tools that enable enthusiasts and researchers to effortlessly predict the species of Iris flowers based on their characteristics.

### Solution

This project addresses this need by developing 'FloralForecast,' a Streamlit-powered application utilizing a Random Forest Classifier.
